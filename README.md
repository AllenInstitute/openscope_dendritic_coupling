This repo contains code to generate stimuli for our colleagues at Allen Institute Brain Science (AIBS) to use.

Specifically, the stimuli will be:
1. Sparse Gabor sequences
2. Optic flow mismatch bricks

Based on: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/10/03/197608.full.pdf

Dependencies:
- python 2.7
- psychopy
- camstim

Note:
- The AIBS package camstim appears to require pywin32 and the experiments are run using a computer running Windows.
