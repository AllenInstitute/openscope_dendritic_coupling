OpenScope Credit Assignment Passive Training Stimuli
====================================================

- There is one habituation script per day, and it is fully contained (i.e., it does not depend on any other scripts we've written).
- There are 30 second grayscreen periods at the start and the end of the session.
- The session comprises a Gabor stimulus block, only.
- None of the habituation stimuli contain any of the “mismatch” or “surprise” stimulus components, as described in the pilot experiment plan.
- The day numbers are described in accordance with the table circulated by Carol. So the amount of time for each script is:
(day6, 10mins); (day7, 20mins); (day8, 30mins); (day9, 40mins); (day10, 50mins)

Gabor Stimulus Description
--------------------------
- 30 Gabors with random locations in each of the frames (A,B,C,D).
- Each Gabor has size sampled uniformly from 10-20 vis deg (FWHM); width and height are the same.
- Contrast is 100%.
- Spatial frequency is 0.04 cycles/deg and phase is 0.25.
- Gabors come in 4 frames (A,B,C,D), each of which has a different set of positions and sizes for the Gabors.
- The same set of Gabor locations and sizes is maintained for an entire session, but changes between sessions and animals.
- Sequence is ABCD_ABCD_ABCD_..., where “_” is the blank grayscreen frame.
- Each frame lasts 0.3 seconds, and the sequence lasts 1.5 seconds.
- At each sequence repetition, the mean orientation is either {0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315}  degrees.
- At each sequence repetition, individual Gabor orientations are randomly drawn from circular Gaussian with mean set to the sequence mean, and standard deviation of 0.25 rad.
